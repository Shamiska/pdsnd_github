### Project Title
Bikeshare Project :bike:

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

My project allows the user to enter a city to explore the bikeshare data by day, month, or over all the months. The city choices were Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You can explore the following statistics:

+ Popular times of travel
+ Popular stations and trips
+ Trip duration
+ User info



### Files used
There are three .csv files and one .py file
+ chicago.csv
+ new_york_city.csv
